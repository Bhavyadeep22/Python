# Set is a collection of non-repetitive elements. for eg
a={1,3,2,5,1,3,5,8,9,0,3}
print(a)                       # this will not print the elements which are repeating and sort the elements,


# EMPTY SET
#if we write
a={}
print(a)
# this sytnax will create an empty dictionary not a empty set. ...IMPORTANT

b=set()
print(b)
# this will create an empty set
